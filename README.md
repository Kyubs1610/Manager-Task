# Manager-Task

In your terminal, this should be the output :

Welcome to your task manager, Press:
1. to see all your tasks
2. to add a task
3. to delete a task
4. to mark a task as done
5. to Exit the task manager

After that it will take an user input and react accordingly. Each time one of the action has been performed it should return to the menu. (Except of course if we select to exit the program.)
